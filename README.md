# angular-webpack-seed
This is a seed project for Angular 1.5+ using Webpack and Bootstrap

So I have built many Angular apps using Bower, and I am fairly new to Webpack. I wanted to remove Bower Components and bundle my app using Webpack into a an app bundle and a vendor bundle. Bundling Angular was fairly simple, but bundling Bootstrap was much more complex. The only examples I found were using ES6, and my apps are still on ES5. I pieced together several examples until I made it work.
